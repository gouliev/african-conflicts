In this dataset there are several machine learning models that can be applied to predict different things, depending on the research question and the variables of interest. Some examples of potential models are

Predicting the likelihood of a conflict event occurring in a specific region or country based on past conflict data and other relevant variables such as socio-economic indicators, demographics, and political stability.

Predicting the intensity of a conflict event based on the type of conflict, actors involved, location, and other relevant variables such as the number of fatalities, displacement, and destruction of infrastructure.

Predicting the duration of a conflict event based on the same variables as above, as well as the time since the conflict started, the level of external intervention, and the success of conflict resolution efforts.

In this notebook, I do some simple exploaratory analysis of the data, my plan is to work on it down the line when I get free time in between work and university studies!
